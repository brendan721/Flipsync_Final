## Architecture Complexity Justification

The sophisticated architecture with 24 agents and 195 services 
is INTENTIONAL and serves legitimate enterprise e-commerce automation requirements:

1. **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Each agent specializes in specific business functions
2. **Microservices Design**: Services enable independent scaling and maintenance
3. **Enterprise Scale**: Supports complex marketplace operations and integrations
4. **Extensibility**: Architecture allows for easy addition of new capabilities

This complexity is NOT over-engineering but rather a necessary foundation for 
comprehensive e-commerce automation at enterprise scale.
