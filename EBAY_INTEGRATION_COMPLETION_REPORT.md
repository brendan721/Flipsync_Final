The FlipSync eBay inventory integration has been **successfully completed** with all caching issues resolved and the sophisticated 35+ agent system fully operational.

---

## 🔍 **ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED & RESOLVED**

### **Issue:** Flutter App Caching Problem
- **Symptom:** Browser logs showed old API endpoint calls (`/marketplace/ebay/status` instead of `/marketplace/ebay/status/public`)
- **Root Cause:** Built JavaScript contained both old and new endpoint references
- **Source:** Remaining old endpoint URLs in Dart source code files

### **Files Updated:**
1. **`mobile/lib/core/network/api_client_impl.dart`**
   - ❌ Old: `/api/v1/marketplace/ebay/status`
   - ✅ New: `/api/v1/marketplace/ebay/status/public`
   - ❌ Old: `/api/v1/marketplace/status`
   - ✅ New: `/api/v1/analytics/dashboard`

### **Resolution Process:**
1. ✅ Identified old endpoint references in source code
2. ✅ Updated all Dart files to use public endpoints
3. ✅ Performed complete `flutter clean` and rebuild
4. ✅ Verified built JavaScript contains only correct endpoints
5. ✅ Tested complete integration workflow
