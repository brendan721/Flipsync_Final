# Decision Pipeline Vision Alignment

This document outlines how the Decision Pipeline component aligns with FlipSync's vision elements.

## Vision Elements

FlipSync's vision consists of four core elements:

1. **Interconnected Agent System (10/10)**
2. **Mobile-First Approach (10/10)**
3. **Conversational Interface (9/10)**
4. **Intelligent Decision Making (9-10/10)**

The Decision Pipeline is designed to support all four vision elements, with a particular focus on Intelligent Decision Making.
