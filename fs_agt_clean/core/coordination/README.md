# Core Coordination Layer

The Core Coordination Layer is a critical component of the FlipSync application that enables the interconnected agent vision. It provides the foundation for agent communication, coordination, knowledge sharing, and decision making.

## Overview

The Core Coordination Layer consists of the following components:

- **Event System**: Enables asynchronous, loosely-coupled communication between agents
- **Coordinator**: Manages agent registration, discovery, and task delegation
- **Knowledge Repository**: Provides shared knowledge storage and retrieval
- **Decision Pipeline**: Enables intelligent, adaptive decision making

The Core Coordination Layer is designed to be:

- **Mobile-optimized**: Efficient operation on mobile devices
- **Vision-aligned**: Supporting all core vision elements
- **Robust**: Comprehensive error handling and recovery
- **Scalable**: Capable of handling complex agent ecosystems

## Components

### Event System

The Event System enables asynchronous, loosely-coupled communication between agents. It is the foundation of the interconnected agent vision, allowing agents to communicate without direct dependencies.

Key features:
- Event-based communication
- Correlation ID tracking
- Event persistence and replay
- Mobile optimization

### Coordinator

The Coordinator manages agent registration, discovery, and task delegation. It enables hierarchical coordination between agents, with executive agents delegating tasks to specialist agents.

Key features:
- Agent registration and discovery
- Task delegation and tracking
- Result aggregation
- Conflict resolution

*Status: To be implemented*

### Knowledge Repository

The Knowledge Repository provides shared knowledge storage and retrieval. It enables agents to share insights and information, creating a collective intelligence.

Key features:
- Knowledge storage and retrieval
- Subscription-based updates
- Knowledge validation
- Relevance-based search

*Status: To be implemented*

### Decision Pipeline

The Decision Pipeline enables intelligent, adaptive decision making. It provides a structured approach to making decisions, incorporating multiple inputs and learning from outcomes.

Key features:
- Multiple input incorporation
- Decision validation
- Outcome tracking
- Feedback loops

*Status: To be implemented*

## Vision Alignment

The Core Coordination Layer is designed to support FlipSync's vision elements:

### Interconnected Agent System

- **Event System**: Enables asynchronous, loosely-coupled communication between agents
- **Coordinator**: Manages agent relationships and task delegation
- **Knowledge Repository**: Enables knowledge sharing between agents
- **Decision Pipeline**: Enables coordinated decision making

### Mobile-First Approach

- **Efficient Operation**: Minimizes resource usage on mobile devices
- **Offline Support**: Enables operation without continuous connectivity
- **Battery Efficiency**: Minimizes battery usage
- **Adaptive Behavior**: Adapts to device capabilities and state

### Conversational Interface

- **Conversation Context**: Maintains conversation context across agents
- **Intent Propagation**: Propagates user intent across agents
- **Response Coordination**: Coordinates responses from multiple agents
- **Conversation Flow**: Manages complex conversation flows

### Intelligent Decision Making

- **Decision Context**: Maintains decision context across agents
- **Confidence Levels**: Incorporates confidence in decisions
- **Feedback Loops**: Learns from decision outcomes
- **Adaptation**: Adapts decision strategies based on feedback
