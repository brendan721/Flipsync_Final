## üîß **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS**

### **Mobile Integration Fix - Technical Approach**

**Root Cause Analysis**:
- API endpoints returning status code 0 (connection failure)
- Authentication token flow interruption
- CORS configuration issues for mobile requests

**Implementation Steps**:
1. **Network Connectivity Debug**:
   ```bash
   # Test API endpoint accessibility
   curl -v http://localhost:8001/api/v1/health
   curl -v http://localhost:8001/api/v1/agents/status
   ```

2. **Authentication Flow Validation**:
   ```javascript
   // Mobile app authentication test
   const authResponse = await fetch('/api/v1/auth/login', {
     method: 'POST',
     headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
     body: JSON.stringify({ email: 'test@example.com', password: 'SecurePassword!' })
   });
   ```

3. **CORS Configuration Update**:
   ```python
   # Update CORS settings in main.py
   CORS_ORIGINS = [
     "http://localhost:3000",
     "http://localhost:8080",
     "http://127.0.0.1:3000",
     "capacitor://localhost",  # Add for mobile
     "ionic://localhost"       # Add for mobile
   ]
   ```

### **Security Hardening - Implementation Checklist**

**SSL Certificate Configuration**:
- [ ] Obtain production SSL certificates
- [ ] Configure nginx/reverse proxy with SSL
- [ ] Update application to enforce HTTPS
- [ ] Test SSL configuration with SSL Labs

**Secret Management Implementation**:
- [ ] Replace hardcoded secrets in .env files
- [ ] Implement HashiCorp Vault or AWS Secrets Manager
- [ ] Update application to fetch secrets at runtime
- [ ] Rotate all production secrets

**Security Headers Configuration**:
```python
# Add to FastAPI middleware
security_headers = {
    "X-Content-Type-Options": "nosniff",
    "X-Frame-Options": "DENY",
    "X-XSS-Protection": "1; mode=block",
    "Strict-Transport-Security": "max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains",
    "Referrer-Policy": "strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
}
```

### **Database Optimization - Performance Tuning**

**PostgreSQL Configuration Updates**:
```sql
-- Production PostgreSQL settings
ALTER SYSTEM SET shared_buffers = '256MB';
ALTER SYSTEM SET effective_cache_size = '1GB';
ALTER SYSTEM SET maintenance_work_mem = '64MB';
ALTER SYSTEM SET checkpoint_completion_target = 0.9;
ALTER SYSTEM SET wal_buffers = '16MB';
ALTER SYSTEM SET default_statistics_target = 100;
SELECT pg_reload_conf();
```

**Connection Pool Optimization**:
```python
# Update database.py configuration
DATABASE_CONFIG = {
    "pool_size": 25,
    "max_overflow": 40,
    "pool_timeout": 20,
    "pool_pre_ping": True,
    "pool_recycle": 1800,
